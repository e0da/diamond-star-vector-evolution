How about a world where you click to place plants, herbivores, and carnivores,
and plants also optionally spawn randomly. Then the herbivores and carnivores
can evolve to survive and reproduce! With real fake genetics! Build it
iteratively.

First, just predator and prey. Pit them against each other so the herbavore
avoids the predator and the carnivore chases the prey.
